TO DO

Methods / functions
- methods for remaining endpoints
    - get /ape/v1/sonics_wifi currently returning zero results (but valid return)
    - get /ape/v1/sonics_wifi/{id}
    - put /ape/v1/properties/{property_id}/notifications - no documentation on what fields can be updated via API.
    - put /ape/v1/properties/{property_id}/settings - no documentation on what fields can be updated via API.
    - put /ape/v1/sonics_wifi/{id}
- appropriate returns
- hide/remove unnecessary print statements

OOP
- handle session object properly
- rewrite for asynchronous code (may need to use aiohttp rather than requests)

OTHERS
- capturing full log of incidents, let user chose to displaying all/open/last incidents etc.
- add logging to library

README
- fix markdown in readme (formatting for / in table doesn't display in PYPI, needs encoded?)
- re-write readme

In Progress:
- home assistant integration

later:
- appropriate handling for users with multiple sonics, signals or properties, at the minute only first devices returned are utilised
- Refactor code (reduce duplication of lines calling request library)
- Separate functions to different files if appropriate, authentication & user functions, device interactions (sonics & signals), incidents

DONE
Check commits for all progress, lots more than just these
- create and use function for common headers
- set token expiry
- initiate checks for token being present, check if token valid, if not request one, if expiring soon, renew it.
- functions - timestamps returned in telemetry and signals json response, converted to datetime (do I want to do this in the library or leave it to Home assistant etc)
