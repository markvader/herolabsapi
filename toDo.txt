TO DO
- initiate session properly
- rewrite for asynchronous code (will need to use aiohttp rather than requests)
- functions - appropriate returns
- appropriate handling for users with multiple sonics, signals or properties, at the minute i only utilise first devices returned
- hide print statements
- capturing full log of incidents, displaying all/open/last etc
- add logging

start:
- home assistant integration

later:
- Refactor
- Separate functions to different files if appropriate, login & user functions, device interactions (sonics & signals), incidents

DONE
- create and use function for common headers
- set token expiry
- initiate checks for token being present, check if token valid, if not request one, if expiring soon, renew it.
- functions - timestamps returned in telemetry and signals json response, converted to datetime




example format for datetime
self._auth_token_expiration: Optional[datetime] = datetime(2022, 4, 21, 1, 30, 29, 469926)
